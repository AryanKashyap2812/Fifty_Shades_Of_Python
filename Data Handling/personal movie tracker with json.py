 Challenge:  Personal Movie Tracker with JSON

Create a Python CLI tool that lets users maintain their own personal movie database, like a mini IMDb.

Your program should:
1. Store all movie data in a `movies.json` file.
2. Each movie should have:
   - Title
   - Genre
   - Rating (out of 10)
3. Allow the user to:
   - Add a movie
   - View all movies
   - Search movies by title or genre
   - Exit the app

Bonus:
- Prevent duplicate titles from being added
- Format output in a clean table
- Use JSON for reading/writing structured data
