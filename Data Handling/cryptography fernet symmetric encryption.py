 Challenge: Offline Notes Locker

Create a terminal-based app that allows users to save, view, and search personal notes securely in an encrypted file.

Your program should:
1. Let users add notes with title and content.
2. Automatically encrypt each note using Fernet (AES under the hood).
3. Store all encrypted notes in a single `.vault` file (JSON format).
4. Allow listing of titles and viewing/decrypting selected notes.
5. Support searching by title or keyword.

Bonus:
- Add timestamps to notes.
- Use a master password to unlock vault (optional).
